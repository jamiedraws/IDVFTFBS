<p><strong>How do I clean my Flawless Legs&trade; unit?</strong><br>
NOTE: Do NOT use Flawless Legs&trade; in the shower or submerge it in water to clean. While the unit is water resistant, it is NOT water-proof.
To clean your Flawless Legs unit, hold the main body of the shaver in one hand, and with the other hand, grip the tabs on the lower head and pull it away from the upper head.<br>
To remove hair clippings from the lower head, simply turn it over and gently shake it out over a trash can. Use the unit's cleaning brush to dislodge and remove any clippings stuck in the heads.
