<p itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><strong itemprop="name">How do I clean my Flawless&reg; Legs&trade; unit?</strong><br>
	<span itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><span itemprop="text">NOTE: Do NOT use Flawless&reg; Legs&trade; in the shower or submerge it in water to clean. While the unit is water resistant, it is NOT water-proof.
To clean your Flawless&reg; Legs&reg; unit, hold the main body of the shaver in one hand, and with the other hand, grip the tabs on the lower head and pull it away from the upper head.<br>
To remove hair clippings from the lower head, simply turn it over and gently shake it out over a trash can. Use the unit's cleaning brush to dislodge and remove any clippings stuck in the heads.</span></span>

<p itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><strong itemprop="name">Are &ldquo;dry shave&rdquo; results the same as a &ldquo;wet&rdquo; shave?</strong><br>
	<span itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><span itemprop="text">With Flawless&reg; Nu Razor&trade; you can shave without the shower, or &ldquo;dry shave&rdquo; anywhere anytime. The results to the naked eye are the same. Legs will appear as clean shaved as with a wet razor. There is, however, a very slight difference in touch as a dry shave will leave a very teeny hair shaft left behind. Again, this is typically invisible to the naked eye, but hair shaft may be felt. Additionally, results typically improve with continued use. The convenience of a dry shave, with a visually clean smooth leg, no nicks, cuts, or irritation, is for most women a desirable alternative to the inconvenience of the wet shave.</span></span>
